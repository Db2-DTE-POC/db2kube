# Db2 Cartridge and MiniKube
This lab is meant to give the user and introduction to the use of Kubernetes in a smaller developer environment. The lab will take the user through the use of MiniKube, Helm, Kubernetes and then the installation of a Db2 system. Once the system is up and running, a variety of tools will be used to check the connectivity to the Db2 database.
